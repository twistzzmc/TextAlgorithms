I'm testing these three options (In order: #1 Trie, #2 Suffix Tree using McCreight (with links) #3 Suffix Tree without links)
in six tests with increasing number of characters (exact amount given next to examples).
First five examples follow "abaabbaaabbac" pattern and the last one is in file 1997_714.txt.
The last example due to usage of a lot of unknown characters will NOT be tested inTrie structure and tree without links.
Time is given in seconds.
